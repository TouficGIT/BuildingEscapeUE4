# Building Escape  
A UE4 training project that I followed from this Udemy course : https://www.udemy.com/share/1000hGBEUTdlZaQ3o=/

## Concept

-   The core concept is simple: escape the room
    
-   You awaken in a locked room, unable to escape
    
-   Use environmental clues such as light and sound to determine what to do next
    
-   Trigger pressure plates and solve puzzles to progress towards the exit.

## Rules

-   No lose condition, apart from the feeling you’re going to die in this room if you don’t get out!
    
-   Anything that you can do, you are allowed to do
    
-   You win by finally exiting the room.
